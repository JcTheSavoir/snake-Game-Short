Project Details and goals:

* Game Name: Snake
* Create a game from scratch without following a tutorial/video/etc.
* Research via playing the game, looking into what a specific method can do and similar are allowed. 
  EX: You can look up what arguments 'querySelector' needs.  You can not look up "how to use querySelector to move an element from one grid to another".
* This will not be the most efficient method of making the classic game "Snake".  Instead, it's meant to test researching skills along with problem solving; showing how to build something from scratch that you haven't seen before.
